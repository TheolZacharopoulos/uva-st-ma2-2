## 4.8
Let _a_ and _b_ be elements of a set.
Let _R<sup>+</sup>_ denote the transitive closure of the relation _R_.
Let _R<sup>s</sup>_ denote the symmetric closure of the relation _R_.

If _R = {(a,b)}_

then _R<sup>+</sup> = R_

and _R<sup>+s</sup> = R<sup>s</sup> = {(a,b),(b,a)}_

and _R<sup>s+</sup> = {(a,a),(a,b),(b,a),(b,b)}_

and _R<sup>+s</sup> =/= R<sup>s+</sup>_
